Tested Controller class using the controller_harness.cpp file.
Found a bug in the model - when adding a passenger to the map, the passenger pointer is null ->solved with Tom
Found bug in CLIView - when displaying passengers using the pair of iterators, the iterator goes one extra step, dereferencing the termination pointer which is null
Worked on GUIView.cpp file for the GUI version of the program.
