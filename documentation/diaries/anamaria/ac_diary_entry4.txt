Anamaria Ciucanu - diary entry 4
Date: 25/11/2013 - 26/11/2013

After the meeting, worked on debugging the integrated version of the program
Made some changes in class responsibility (model, controller) and wrote a few auxiliary methods 
(such as hasSameDayFlights) for the program to work as expected. 
Wrote a few comments and observations on what else needs to be done or taken into consideration.
